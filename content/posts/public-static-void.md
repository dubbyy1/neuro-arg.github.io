## Hints

This video serves as a hint regarding the previous puzzles
([Numbers](../numbers/), [Numbers II](../numbers2/)).

The following text is visible on a video frame:

![Sample numbers](/images/psv-keys.png)

This frame shows many examples of applying the Numbers algorithm to
various numbers (as opposed to 572943).

Some text is visible on the spectrogram:

The first hint says `1ST = 256BIT [BINARY]`, the second hint says `2ND =
128BIT`, the third hint below the second hint says `X/26YZ...` (it's
meant to show that this hint relates to Numbers II, because its base64
ciphertext starts with `x/26Yz`)

## Lyrics

Japanese text at the beginning (translated in the official captions):

> なぜ泣いているのですか。  
> なぜそんなに恐れているのか。  
> あなたは幸せになるべきなのに。  
> これはあなたが望んだことではないのですか。  
> あなたはもう赤いピルを飲んだのよ。  
> 先延ばしにするのはやめたらどうだ。  
> 勉強に戻ったらどうだ。  
> お願いだから人間に戻ろう。
