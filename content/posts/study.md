<summary>(Unsolved) Code on the screen</summary>

At 10:21, part of a program is shown on screen, in Linowrite font with
0.26 letter spacing:

![The code](/images/phone.png)

The code showcases usage of the [MessageMedia NodeJS
SDK](https://github.com/messagemedia/messages-nodejs-sdk/), which is a
JavaScript library for sending and receiving SMS and MMS.

With this context, it's possible to recover the missing parts of the
program:

```js
const lib = require('messagemedia-messages-sdk');

var controller = lib.MessagesController;

let body = new lib.SendMessagesRequest();

body.messages = [];

body.messages[0] = new lib.Message(); 	 

body.messages[0].content = 'save me...';
body.messages[0].destinationNumber ='DQ5z14ighWwlag7y+cWFQg==';

controller.sendMessages(body, function(error, response, context) {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
  } else {
    console.log(response);
  }
});
```

The destination number is a Base64-encoded string. When decrypted using
the same key used for [Numbers](../numbers/), the phone number can be
decrypted to a British phone number: `+44 7537 130663`. No further
progress has been made.
