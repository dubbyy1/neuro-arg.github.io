## Meaning Speculation

If we're to believe the
[Study](../study/#i-dont-want-to-be-human--is-anyone-watching) phone
number is Neuro-sama's, this could mean we shouldn't message it for now.

If we further assume Neuro-sama is the "engineer"'s little sister,
"she's not answering my calls either" from [Numbers
II](../numbers2/#answer) would make sense.

Either way, no further clues have been found in this video.
